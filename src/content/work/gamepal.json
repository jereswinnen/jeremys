  "description": "GamePal is an iPhone app designed to help gamers organize and track their game collections effortlessly. Building my own app had been a long-time goal, and in 2024, I made it a reality by learning Swift and SwiftUI. My background in UX/UI design played a key role in crafting an experience that feels intuitive and at home on iOS. From concept to launch, I focused on seamless navigation, polished interactions, and a design that enhances the joy of managing a game library.",
