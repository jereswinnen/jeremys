  "description": "Designing Shelf for iPad at Lickability was an exercise in iteration and refinement. I explored bold color palettes, file previews, and scalable iconography to balance aesthetics with usability. Through multiple design phases, I refined the icons—adjusting size, shape, and saturation—to achieve a professional look that suited the target market. Despite the app not launching due to resource constraints, the project was a success. In just six weeks, I designed a full-fledged UI supporting Split Screen, Slide Over, and multiple orientations, delivering a polished and adaptable experience.",
